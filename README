Files explained:

- 'otherScripts' consists of scripts used to check the information extracted.
- 'reacs' contains the list of reactions required when parsing KGML files. Created to reduce processing time due to querying KEGG
- 'hsa_gene_list.json' organizes the gene symbols associated with each KEGG gene ids.
- 'ginfo.json' keeps track of queried results for each KEGG gene. Created to reduce processing time due to querying KEGG.
- 'hsa_list.txt' is the list of all human pathways found on KEGG.
