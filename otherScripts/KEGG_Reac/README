KEGG_Reac.json:
{<Reaction ID>: [ <Reversibility>, <Conflicting reversibility?> ]}

KEGG reaction annotations are based on research efforts from the scientific community (journals, etc). Just because a reaction says it is irreversible, that does not mean necessarily that it actually is irreversible (from curators of KEGG DB).  Therefore, users should be careful when interpreting reversibility information.

It was also found that some reversibility information are mismatching in some pathways (i.e. shows up as irreversible in KEGG Reactions entry, but shows up as reversible in KGML)

The purpose of the scripts in this directory was to create a list of KEGG reactions, record their reversibility information, and determine whether they have a conflicting reversibility information.
